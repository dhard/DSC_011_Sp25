  Output: "Welcome back to DSC 011 after Spring Break! For the next week or so, 
  we'll use Swirl to learn and practice fundamental data science programming skills 
  and concepts in the base R language. Remember, when you see an elipsis (...) just
  press \"Return\" or \"Enter\" to continue."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Please run the R built-in command Sys.info() to document your system.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Because R is a statistical programming language, 
  it comes with built-in datasets. Like everything else in R, 
  these datasets are associated to R objects with unique names. 
  Before Spring Break, we met the Nile dataset associated Nile R 
  object.  Use the built-in help() function or ? operator of R 
  to get documentation on the Nile dataset."
  CorrectAnswer: help(Nile)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('?Nile', '?"Nile"', 'help(Nile)', 'help("Nile")')
  Hint: "Try entering ?Nile or help(Nile)"

- Class: mult_question

  AnswerChoices: Annual flow of the river Nile over 100 years;Commercial traffic on the river Nile;Mentions of the river Nile in literature from the 20th Century.
  CorrectAnswer: Annual flow of the river Nile over 100 years
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Annual flow of the river Nile over 100 years')
