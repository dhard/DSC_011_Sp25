  Output: "Welcome back to DSC 011 after Spring Break! For the next week or so, 
  we'll use Swirl to learn and practice fundamental data science programming skills 
  and concepts in the base R language. Remember, when you see an elipsis (...) just
  press \"Return\" or \"Enter\" to continue."

- Class: text
  Output: "Please do not use Swirl's skip() function to complete this assignment. Skipped questions will not receive credit."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Please run the R built-in command Sys.info() to document your system. 
  CorrectAnswer: Sys.info()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Sys.info()')
  Hint: Enter Sys.info() at the R prompt (>)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Because R is a statistical programming language, 
  it comes with built-in datasets. Like everything else in R, 
  these datasets are associated to R objects with unique names. 
  Before Spring Break, we met the Nile dataset associated Nile R 
  object.  Use the built-in help() function or ? operator of R 
  to get documentation on the Nile dataset."
  CorrectAnswer: help(Nile)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('?Nile', '?"Nile"', 'help(Nile)', 'help("Nile")')
  Hint: "Try entering ?Nile or help(Nile)"

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What data are sampled in R's built-in Nile dataset?
  AnswerChoices: Annual flow of the river Nile over 100 years;Commercial traffic on the river Nile;Mentions of the river Nile in literature from the 20th Century.
  CorrectAnswer: Annual flow of the river Nile over 100 years
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Annual flow of the river Nile over 100 years')
  Hint: Read the R documentation for the Nile object.

- Class: text
  Output: "In R, vectors are collections of data of the same \"type\" or \"mode\"."

- Class: text
  Output: "In R, vectors may be of type \"double\", \"integer\", \"character\", \"complex\", \"logical\" or others."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Vector types and modes enforce rules on what kinds of values vectors can contain. For example, logical vectors may contain only the values \"TRUE\" and \"FALSE\", in addition to certain values that any vector can contain like \"NULL\" and \"NA\"."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Inspect the Nile object by evaluating it by name at the R prompt."
  CorrectAnswer: Nile
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Nile')
  Hint: Enter Nile

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Aside from the metadata in the output at the top, which kind of statistical data does the Nile object contain?
  AnswerChoices: Numerical;Categorical;Dates/Times 
  CorrectAnswer: Numerical
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Numerical')
  Hint: Discuss with your team. 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Inspect the type of the Nile object by calling the typeof() function on it."
  CorrectAnswer: typeof(Nile)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='typeof(Nile)')
  Hint: Enter typeof(Nile)  
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Perhaps surprisingly, the type of the Nile object vector is \"double\" which corresponds to floating-point numbers with values after a decimal point, although they all look like integers." 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "In R, vector modes are similar to types, except the \"double\" and \"integer\" vector type are both of the \"numeric\" mode.
  In R, the distinction between numeric and character modes is most important. Inspect the mode of the Nile object by calling the typeof() function on it."
  CorrectAnswer: mode(Nile)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mode(Nile)')
  Hint: Enter mode(Nile)  

- Class: text
  Output: "It is important to understand how R prints vectors. If you scroll up to where you inspected the value of Nile, you will notice a sequence of integers along the left side showing the corresponding indices of the values printed at the beginning of each row."

- Class: exact_question
  Output: To test your understanding of how R prints vectors, what is the value of the 46th element of Nile?
  CorrectAnswer: 1120
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='1120')
  Hint: Look at the output of Nile and use the indices in square brackets to find the 46th element.
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the explanatory variable of the Nile dataset?
  AnswerChoices: time in years;flow in cubic meters
  CorrectAnswer: time in years
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='time in years')
  Hint: The explanatory variable is typically plotted on the x-axis.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the response variable of the Nile dataset?
  AnswerChoices: time in years;flow in cubic meters
  CorrectAnswer: flow in cubic meters
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='flow in cubic meters')
  Hint: The response variable is typically plotted on the y-axis.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: A basic statistical summary for statistical data is to characterize its frequency distribution, and answer how often a statistical variable takes a certain value or range of values. Last time we examined the frequency distribution of flow on the river Nile by making a histogram with the built-in hist() function. Use this function to make a histogram of the Nile dataset now.
  CorrectAnswer: hist(Nile)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='hist(Nile)')
  Hint: Enter hist(Nile).

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the explanatory variable of a histogram of the Nile dataset?
  AnswerChoices: time in years;flow in cubic meters;frequency
  CorrectAnswer: time in years
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='flow in cubic meters')
  Hint: The explanatory variable is typically plotted on the x-axis.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the response variable of a histogram of the Nile dataset?
  AnswerChoices: time in years;flow in cubic meters;frequency
  CorrectAnswer: frequency
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='frequency')
  Hint: The response variable is typically plotted on the y-axis.


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Another classical way to visualize a frequency distribution is with a stem-and-leaf plot AKA stem-plot. It is equivalent to a histogram and involves rounding numbers after the second most significant digit. Make a stem-plot of the Nile data using the R built-in stem() function.
  CorrectAnswer: stem(Nile)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='stem(Nile)')
  Hint: Enter stem(Nile)

- Class: exact_question
  Output: Discuss with your team how to interpret the stem-plot, noting the message at the top \" The decimal point is 2 digit(s) to the right of the |\". What value approximates the minimum flow in the data-set shown in the stem-plot?
  CorrectAnswer: 460
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='460')
  Hint: Discuss with your team how to interpret values in the stem-plot.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Compare your answer of the sten-plot approximate minimum value to the actual minimum by using the min() function on the Nile vector.
  CorrectAnswer: min(Nile)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='min(Nile)')
  Hint: Enter min(Nile).

- Class: text
  Output: Notice that when you called hist(Nile), a window popped up with a plot of the histogram of the Nile vector. This behavior is called a "side-effect" because the plot is not returned directly as the output of the hist() function. Because R is a functional programming language, such side effects are rare.

- Class: text
  Output: What if you wanted to get more information about the histogram that hist(Nile) created, such as what values are the cut-offs for each histogram bin?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "It turns out that hist(Nile) returns more information about the histogram in an object, and we can capture that information by using R's assignment operator (<-) to 
create a new R object to hold the return value of hist(Nile). Although we lost this return value by not using assignment the first time, we can just re-run the code using the assignment another time.
Write an R expression that saves the return value of hist(Nile) in a new R object called \"hist_Nile\""
  CorrectAnswer: hist_Nile <- hist(Nile)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='hist_Nile <- hist(Nile)')
  Hint: Check with your team how to use assignment to save a return value in R.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Examine the mode of the hist_Nile object to see what kind of R data type it is.
  CorrectAnswer: mode(hist_Nile)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mode(hist_Nile)')
  Hint: Enter mode(hist_Nile).

- Class: text
  Output: R functions frequently use lists as objects to hold return values.

- Class: text
  Output: Lists are a much more general and generalized data structure in R than vectors. Unlike with vectors, list elements may be heterogeneous, of different types, and list elements may even be other lists. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To examine more information about the Nile histogram, evaluate the hist_Nile return object.
  CorrectAnswer: hist_Nile
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='hist_Nile')
  Hint: Evaluate hist_Nile

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The elements of the hist_Nile return object have names. To see them, call the names() function on the return object.
  CorrectAnswer: names(hist_Nile)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='names(hist_Nile)')
  Hint: Evaluate names(hist_Nile)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To understand more about the structure of a list and the types of its elements, use the str() function on the hist return value object.
  CorrectAnswer: str(Nile)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='str(Nile)')
  Hint: Enter str(Nile).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: To select a list element by its name, use the $ selection operator. Test it out by selecting the density element of the return value object.
  CorrectAnswer: hist_Nile$density
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='hist_Nile$density')
  Hint: Ask your team for help using the $ operator on the hist_Nile list.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: To understand the return value of a function, use the documentation for that function. Check the documentation for the hist() function down in the \"Value:\" section. What information does the \"density\" element hold?
  AnswerChoices: relative frequencies;midpoints;bin breaks
  CorrectAnswer: relative frequencies
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='relative frequencies')
  Hint: Please check with your team if you are having trouble.


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Write an R expression to examine the R data mode of the density element of the hist return value object.
  CorrectAnswer: mode(hist_Nile$density)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mode(hist_Nile$density)')
  Hint: Please check with your team if you are having trouble.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Is the density element of the return value a vector, a list, or something else?
  AnswerChoices: vector;list;something else
  CorrectAnswer: vector
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='vector')
  Hint: Please check with your team if you are having trouble.


- Class: text
  Output: In R, many functions are vectorized, meaning they automatically compute meaningful answers for vectors of any size.

- Class: text
  Output: In R, it is almost always usually faster to rely on vectorization rather than using a for loop to iterate over a vector.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use the mean() function to compute the mean annual flow of the Nile river from the Nile dataset.
  CorrectAnswer: mean(Nile)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(Nile)')
  Hint: Enter mean(Nile).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: The arithmetic mean of a sample of values is the sum of values divided by the number of values. Use the sum() and length() functions and the R division operator (/) to write a valid expression for the mean of the Nile data.
  CorrectAnswer: sum(Nile)/length(Nile)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sum(Nile)/length(Nile)')
  Hint: Please check with your team for help.
