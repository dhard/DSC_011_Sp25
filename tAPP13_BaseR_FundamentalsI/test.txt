| In this lesson, we'll briefly introduce basics of statistical inference, the
| process of drawing conclusions "about a population using noisy statistical
| data where uncertainty must be accounted for". In other words, statistical
| inference lets scientists formulate conclusions from data and quantify the
| uncertainty arising from using incomplete data.
