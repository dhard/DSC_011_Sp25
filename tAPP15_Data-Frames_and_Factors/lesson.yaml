# vector selections

- Class: text
  Output: "Last time, we practiced various ways of selecting elements from vectors, for example using logical vectors or
  indices returned by the order() function with the vector selection operator [."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Let's review a few more fine points about vector selections."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "We'll practice making selections from the built-in character vector 
  called \"letters\" containing the 26 lower-case letters of the English alphabet."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Examine the value of the letters vector now."
  CorrectAnswer: letters
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='letters')
  Hint: "Evaluate the R expression \n\n letters"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Great! Now use the range operator (:) to select the first eight elements of the letters vector."
  CorrectAnswer: letters[1:8]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='letters[1:8]')
  Hint: "The range exression 3:6 evaluates to the same value as the numeric vector c(3,4,5,6). 
  Try using a range expression inside the vector selection operator ([ ])."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "R vectors don't throw errors if you pass in indices larger than their length, they 
  just return the missing data value NA."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "See for yourself! Examine the value of \n\n letters[27]"
  CorrectAnswer: letters[27]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='letters[27]')
  Hint: "Evaluate letters[27]"

- Class: text
  Output: "Any valid R expression that evaluates to a vector of integers can be used with the 
  selection operator, which allows you to select the same elements repeatedly and in any order."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Use the rep() function with a range argument inside a selection on the letters vector 
  to create a character vector in which the last six letters of the alphabet, in alphabetical 
  order, are each repeated three times."
  CorrectAnswer: letters[rep(21:26,each=3)]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='letters[rep(21:26,each=3)]')
  Hint: "The output should look like  \n\n [1] \"u\" \"u\" \"u\" \"v\" \"v\" \"v\" \"w\" \"w\" \"w\"
  \"x\" \"x\" \"x\" \"y\" \"y\" \"y\" \"z\" \"z\" \"z\""

- Class: text
  Output: "In R vector selections, negative indicies imply exclusion of the corresponding elements from 
  the selection. For example, \n\n letters[-1] \n\n excludes \"a\" and evaluates the same as \n\n letters[2:26]." 

- Class: text
  Output: "Mixing positive and negative indices in a selection results in an error. Because operators are
  vectorized, you can use an expression like \n\n -c(1,2,3) \n\n to exclude multiple elements from a selection."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Write a selection using the seq() function to make a character vector that excludes every 
  third letter from the alphabet (this example is most easily computed using negative indices)."
  CorrectAnswer: letters[-seq(3,26,by=3)]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='letters[-seq(3,26,by=3)]')
  Hint: "The output should look like \n\n [1] \"a\" \"b\" \"d\" \"e\" \"g\" \"h\" \"j\" \"k\" \"m\" \"n\" 
  \"p\" \"q\" \"s\" \"t\" \"v\" \"w\" \"y\" \"z\""

- Class: text
  Output: "Now we have covered most of the ins and outs of vector selection expressions in R." 
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Let's turn to study factors, which are a special class of integer vectors in R that model categorical data, especially in 
  regression and other modeling applications."

- Class: video
  Output: "To better understand R factors, please take a minute to study the typology of statistical data from 
  a figure I posted to a Page on CatCourses. Would you like swirl to open this page for you in your browser?"
  VideoLink: https://catcourses.ucmerced.edu/courses/33897/pages/types-of-statistical-data

- Class: text
  Output: "From this figure, we see that categorical statistical variables are non-numerical variables such as 
  \"eye color\" or \"month of birth\"."

- Class: text
  Output: "We also see that categorical variables may be further classified as nominal or ordinal variables."  
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Nominal variables such as \"eye color\" can take one from a set of alternative values for which there exists 
  no natural order. For example, blue eye-color is not less than, greater than, or equal to brown eye-color."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "Ordinal variables such as \"month of birth\" can take alternative values that have a natural order. For exmaple, 
  \"January\" comes before \"February\" and \"hot\" is hotter than \"warm\" which is warmer than \"cool\"."
  
- Class: text
  Output: "In either case, the different alternative values that a factor can take are called its \"levels\"."
    
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "To see factors in action, examine the iris data-set built-in to R by evaluating its name"
  CorrectAnswer: iris
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='iris')
  Hint: "Evaluate the R-expression \"iris\""

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Also look at the structure summary of the iris data-frame, using the str() function"
  CorrectAnswer: str(iris)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='str(iris)')
  Hint: "Evaluate the R-expression \"str(iris)\""

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "And finally look at the statistical summary of the iris data-frame, using the summary() function"
  CorrectAnswer: summary(iris)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(iris)')
  Hint: "Evaluate the R-expression \"summary(iris)\""

- Class: text
  Output: "In the documentation for iris, which you can access with \"?iris\" or \"help(iris),\" you can learn that 
  \"This famous (Fisher's or Anderson's) iris data set gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables 
  sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris.
  The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.\""

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Use the name-selection operator ($) to print the Species field of iris."
  CorrectAnswer: iris$Species
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='iris$Species')
  Hint: "Evaluate the R-expression \"iris$Species\""
 
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Test your understanding! What kind of categorical statistical variable is Species in iris?
  AnswerChoices: nominal;ordinal;both;neither
  CorrectAnswer: nominal
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='nominal')
  Hint: Is there a natural order to different species of irises?
 
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Use up-arrow and ctrl-a, ctrl-e command-line editing to wrap the Species factor of iris with the levels() 
  function, to see its levels."
  CorrectAnswer: levels(iris$Species)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='levels(iris$Species)')
  Hint: "Evaluate the R-expression \"levels(iris$Species)\"" 

- Class: text
  Output: "One of the main uses of factors in R is to enforce data consistency; that is, to enforce that its values all belong
  to a pre-defined set of levels. In practice this guards against treating alternative spellings as belonging to distinct categories." 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "To examine the consequences of this in R, first notice that you can chain selection operators. Write an expression to extract the first element 
  of the Species factor of iris."
  CorrectAnswer: iris$Species[1]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='iris$Species[1]')
  Hint: "Use the vector selection operator [ ] on the named-column selection expression \"iris$Species\"" 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now use up-arrow and command-line editing to modify this selection expression to try to assign the value \"Setosa\" 
  to the first element of the Species factor of iris." 
  CorrectAnswer: iris$Species[1]<-"Setosa"
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='iris$Species[1]<-"Setosa"')
  Hint: "Assign the value to the chained selection from the last problem." 

- Class: text
  Output: "Did you get a warning \"invalid factor level, NA generated\"?"

- Class: text
  Output: "Even though a warning was generated, R did change the value of Species for the first iris in the dataset." 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "To see this, print the first ten rows of iris with the head() function." 
  CorrectAnswer: head(iris)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(iris)')
  Hint: "Call the head() function on iris."

- Class: text
  Output: "It may be surprising that R appears to let you change the value of built-in data objects like iris, 
  but these changes are only temporary. Behind the scenes, R creates a new copy of iris holding the changes 
  which masks the built-in data object. The original value of iris will be restored when you restart R, or 
  if you remove the newly created data-frame iris that is masking the original pre-defined one with the command rm(iris)."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Try removing the altered copy of iris with the command rm(iris)." 
  CorrectAnswer: rm(iris)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='rm(iris)')
  Hint: "Evaluate rm(iris)."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now print the first ten rows of iris with the head() function again." 
  CorrectAnswer: head(iris)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(iris)')
  Hint: "Call the head() function on iris."

- Class: text
  Output: "Did you see that the original value of iris was restored?"

- Class: text
  Output: "To \"re-level\" a factor, that is to update the name(s) of one or more levels, and all of the 
  corresponding elements in the factor correspondingly, assign a character vector with the new level names   
  to the levels() function." 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Try it! Assign the first three elements of the LETTERS vector to the levels of the Species vector of iris." 
  CorrectAnswer: levels(iris$Species)<-LETTERS[1:3]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='levels(iris$Species)<-LETTERS[1:3]')
  Hint: "Use LETTERS[1:3] as the right-hand side of the assignment. In R you can assign directly to a function 
  expression. Here you want to use the function levels()"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Now examine the effect of the assignment on iris$Species."
  CorrectAnswer: iris$Species
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='iris$Species')
  Hint: "Evaluate iris$Species"

- Class: text
  Output: "By default, factors in R are unordered and represent nominal variables. Ordered factors are useful to 
  specify the order of levels for various plotting and modeling functions, and for sorting data." 

- Class: text
  Output: "For example, suppose that the birth months of the youngest five students in our class are given by the character
  vector c(\"December\",\"February\",\"April\",\"February\",\"January\") by increasing age." 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Try sorting this character vector with the function sort(), to see that its default sort order is alphabetical, 
  which is not very useful."
  CorrectAnswer: sort(c("December","February","April","February","January"))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sort(c("December","February","April","February","January"))')
  Hint: "Evaluate the R-expression \n\n sort(c(\"December\",\"February\",\"April\",\"February\",\"January\"))"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Handily, R provides the built-in month.name character vector; evaluate this name to see its value:"
  CorrectAnswer: month.name
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='month.name')
  Hint: "Evaluate the R-expression month.name"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "(Suppose you didn't know there was a defined object called month.name. How would you find it? Like Bash, 
  R provides tab-completion on defined functions and variables. Try it. At the R prompt, enter \"month.\" and hit the Tab key twice to 
  call up all of the objects in th eenvironment whose names start with \"month.\". What is the name of a second pre-defined character vector that 
  starts with the prefix \"month.\" and holds three letter abbreviations of the months?"
  CorrectAnswer: month.abb
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='month.abb')
  Hint: "Use tab-completion to find the other named character vector."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "To make a factor from a character vector, use the factor() or ordered() functions. Evaluate the following expression
  to define the factor months:\n\n months <- factor(c(\"December\",\"February\",\"April\",\"February\",\"January\"),levels=month.name, ordered=T)"
  CorrectAnswer: months <- factor(c("December","February","April","February","January"),levels=month.name, ordered=T)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='months <- factor(c("December","February","April","February","January"),levels=month.name, ordered=T)')
  Hint: "Copy, paste and evaluate the R-expression exactly as shown."

  Output: "Now examine how ordered factors are printed by evaluating the name months"
  CorrectAnswer: months
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='months')
  Hint: "Evaluate the name months"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Also, please use sort() on the months factor to see how ordered factors are sorted."
  CorrectAnswer: sort(months)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sort(months)')
  Hint: "Evaluate the expression name(months)"

- Class: text
  Output: "In tAPP13, I asked you to specify what the explanatory variable is in a histogram of the Nile data. 
  The correct answer was \"flow in (some magnitude of) cubic meters\". Strictly and technically speaking, this is not true." 

- Class: text
  Output: "In computing the histogram, the sample of annual flows was cut into a set of disjoint histogram 
  bins that span the range of the response variable, that is, the flows of the Nile river." 

- Class: text
  Output: "So the explanatory variable in a histogram is a set of bins representing ranges of flow. 
  These bins are uniquely ordered by non-overlapping ranges of flow that they span. Thus the bin categories 
  are an ordinal categorical variable, and the explanatory variable of the Nile histogram is 
  \"an ordered factor representing flow in (a magnitude of) cubic meters\"." 

- Class: text
  Output: "Relatedly, the R function cut() is used to convert a numeric variable into an ordered factor. 
  If an integer number larger than 1 is provided through the breaks= mandatory argument to cut(), then by default 
  an ordered factor will be created by dividing the range of the variable into that number of equal length intervals." 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Try it! Use cut() to create an ordered factor of the Nile data with three levels."
  CorrectAnswer: cut(Nile,breaks=3)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='cut(Nile,breaks=3)')
  Hint: "Call cut() on Nile and pass 3 to the breaks argument."

- Class: text
  Output: "By default the names of the levels encode the breakpoints of the cut. Provide the
  character vector c(\"low\",\"medium\",\"high\") to the labels= optional argument to cut in order
  to give the levels useful names." 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Try it! Use up-arrow and command-line editing to add the the labels= optional argument to cut 
  and provide as argument the character vector c(\"low\",\"medium\",\"high\") in order
  to give the levels useful names."
  CorrectAnswer: cut(Nile,breaks=3,labels=c("low","medium","high"))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='cut(Nile,breaks=3,labels=c("low","medium","high"))')
  Hint: "Call cut() with the labels optional argument to provide the indicated labels."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Tally up the frequencies of each category of flow in the data by using up-arrow ctrl-a, ctrl-e command-line editing 
  to wrap your last R expression with the table() function."
  CorrectAnswer: table(cut(Nile,breaks=3,labels=c("low","medium","high")))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='table(cut(Nile,breaks=3,labels=c("low","medium","high")))')
  Hint: "Wrap your last correct R expression to cut() with the table() function."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "The output of table() shows that in R, it is not just the elements of lists that can have names. 
  Elements of vectors can have names too. To see this, use command-line editing to wrap your last command with the
  function names()."
  CorrectAnswer: names(table(cut(Nile,breaks=3,labels=c("low","medium","high"))))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='names(table(cut(Nile,breaks=3,labels=c("low","medium","high"))))')
  Hint: "Wrap your last correct R expression to table() with the names() function."

- Class: text
  Output: "Fantastic! Now let's turn to data-frames, including importing, selecting and sorting them by column values."

- Class: text
  Output: "This lesson includes validated copies of the baby_clean.csv and baby_letters.txt files that we have been working on. 
  To practice importing csv and tab-delimited data in R you need to provide a UNIX filepath to the files you want to import."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "This lesson provides the path to the baby_clean.csv file in a one-element character vector called \"baby_clean_data_path\".
  Evaluate this name to see its path."
  CorrectAnswer: baby_clean_data_path
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='baby_clean_data_path')
  Hint: "Evaluate baby_clean_data_path"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Try to import the baby_clean data with the R command \"baby_clean <- read.csv(baby_clean_data_path)"
  CorrectAnswer: baby_clean <- read.csv(baby_clean_data_path)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='baby_clean <- read.csv(baby_clean_data_path)')
  Hint: "Evaluate baby_clean <- read.csv(baby_clean_data_path)"

- Class: text
  Output: "To see that something went wrong with importing this data using the default of read.csv(), 
  examine the dimensions (numbers of rows and columns) of the baby_clean data-frame using the dim() function."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "To see that something went wrong with importing this data using the default of read.csv(), 
  examine the dimensions (numbers of rows and columns) of the baby_clean data-frame using the dim() function."
  CorrectAnswer: dim(baby_clean)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dim(baby_clean)')
  Hint: "Evaluate dim(baby_clean)"

- Class: text
  Output: "Remember, there are supposed to be 2800 rows in this data but we obtained 2799!"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "Let's inspect the data to learn more what went wrong. Use the head() function to print the first 10 rows of baby_clean."
  CorrectAnswer: head(baby_clean)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(baby_clean)')
  Hint: "Evaluate head(baby_clean)"  

- Class: text
  Output: "It appears that by default, read.csv() expects there to be header row as the first line of the file to name the data-frame 
  rows."
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output:   "In order to read this data correctly, we need to tell read.csv() that there is no header line for the data by passing 
  the optional argument header=F to read.csv(). In R you can abbreviate TRUE as T and FALSE as F. Use command-line editing to add this
  optional argument to the call to read.csv()"
  CorrectAnswer: baby_clean <- read.csv(baby_clean_data_path,header=F)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='baby_clean <- read.csv(baby_clean_data_path,header=F)')
  Hint: "Pass header=F to your call to read.csv() to read in the baby_clean data correctly."

  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='str(baby_clean)')
  Hint: "Evaluate str(baby_clean)"  

- Class: text
  Output: "Please notice that all of the vectors in baby_clean are either character vectors or numeric vectors.
  Before R version 4.0.0, read.csv() use to treat columns with strings automatically as (ubordered) factors, and you needed to 
  pass the optional argument stringsAsFactors=F in order to avoid this."

- Class: text
  Output: "Since R 4.0.0, you need to explicitly make factors from character vectors if and when you want to use them."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:   "To see what a data-frame with factors looks like, re-import the baby_clean data using the optional argument
  stringsAsFactors = T and assign it to the name baby_clean_f."
  CorrectAnswer: baby_clean_f <- read.csv(baby_clean_data_path,header=F,stringsAsFactors = T)

  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='str(baby_clean_f)')
  Hint: "Evaluate str(baby_clean_f)"  

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Test your understanding! Inspect the output of str(baby_clean_f) to answer the question, how many unique girls names are represented in this data?
  AnswerChoices: 2800;6;537;699
  CorrectAnswer: nominal
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='699')
  Hint: How many levels does the factor contain corresponding to girls names?
 
- Class: text
  Output: "Because it doesn't have names assigned to its column vectors, the baby_clean_f data-frame gives us 
  an opportunity to show how to extract a column using the list selection operator [[]]. Because a data-frame is a list of column vectors, you
  can use [[]] to select column vectors by their indices (starting from 1 on the lett)."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:   "Extract the girls name factor column of baby_clean_f by its numerrical index using the list selection operator [[ ]]"
  CorrectAnswer: baby_clean_f[[5]]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='baby_clean_f[[5]]')
  Hint: "Which column number contains girls names counting from the left? Use this integer inside the selection operator on the data-frame baby_clean_f."  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:   "You can also select columns by name with the [[]] list selection operator by putting it inside quotes, like [[\"rank\"]]. 
  This has the same effect as using the specialized list selection operator ($), but the latter is used more often as you don't have to 
  quote the variable name. Use double quotation marks and the list selection operator [[]] tp extract the 
  \"decade\" vector from the baby_clean data-frame."
  CorrectAnswer: baby_clean[["decade"]]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='baby_clean[["decade"]]')
  Hint: "Use [[]] with the argument \"decade\" on the baby_clean, not the baby_clean_f data-frame."  

- Class: text
  Output: "Compared to Bash+Perl, R's powerful set of operators and functions make it relatively easy to rapidly compute statistical results from 
  data-frames."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:   "For example, call table() on the boy_name column of baby_clean (selected using the $ operator) to compute observation-level 
  frequencies of boy's names in this data."
  CorrectAnswer: table(baby_clean$boy_name)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='table(baby_clean$boy_name)')
  Hint: "Call table on baby_clean$boy_name"  

- Class: text
  Output: "Notice that the output is ordered alphabetically by boy name. Let's use sort to sort the output by frequency instead."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:   "Use command-line editing to wrap the previous expression with the sort() function to sort the output by observation-level frequency."
  CorrectAnswer: sort(table(baby_clean$boy_name))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sort(table(baby_clean$boy_name))')
  Hint: "Compose sort() with table() on baby_clean$boy_name"  

- Class: text
  Output: "Suppose that we wanted to only extract the names that occurred in all decades, for which the frequency is 14."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:   "Use command-line editing on the command from two questions ago using table(), and extend the R expression of table() 
  with a vector selection operator [] using a logical vector to select the elements for which the output of the table command is equal to 14."
  CorrectAnswer: table(baby_clean$boy_name)[table(baby_clean$boy_name) == 14]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='table(baby_clean$boy_name)[table(baby_clean$boy_name) == 14]')
  Hint: "A template for the correct answer is table()[table() == 14]"  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:   "Use command-line editing to wrap the correct answer from the previous question with the names() function to extract a character vector of 
  all boys names observed in every decade."
  CorrectAnswer: names(table(baby_clean$boy_name)[table(baby_clean$boy_name) == 14])
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='names(table(baby_clean$boy_name)[table(baby_clean$boy_name) == 14])')
  Hint: "A template for the correct answer is names(table()[table() == 14])"  

- Class: text
  Output: "Now let's practice extracting and sorting data from data-frames using the data-frame selection operator [,]. All the 
  of the various ways to select elements from vectors using logical vectors and numeric index vectors, 
  apply in both the row-selection and column-selection slots before and after the comma." 
  
- Class: text
  Output: "In addition, you can select one or more columns by their names in the column-selection slot after the comma."

- Class: text
  Output: "If you leave one of the slots empty, then the operator will select all of the rows or columns. 
  For example, baby_clean[baby_clean$girl_name==\"Anna\",] will select all columns from all of the rows 
  for which the girl_name is \"Anna\"."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:   "Try it! Use the data-frame selection operator [,] on the baby_clean data-frame 
  to select all columns from its rows for which the boy_name is == to \"Noah\"."
  CorrectAnswer: baby_clean[baby_clean$boy_name=="Noah",]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='baby_clean[baby_clean$boy_name=="Noah",]')
  Hint: "Your expression needs to use the name baby_clean twice, once inside and once outside the selection operator."  

- Class: text
  Output: "We often need to extract specific columns of data conditional on one or more values of other columns."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:   "Use command-line editing to modify the previous expression to only extract the \"rank\" column from those rows for which 
  boy name is \"Noah\"."
  CorrectAnswer: baby_clean[baby_clean$boy_name=="Noah","rank"]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='baby_clean[baby_clean$boy_name=="Noah","rank"]')
  Hint: "Use \"rank\" with double-quotes in the column-selection slot of the correct solution to the last problem.
  The result should be a numeric vector of ranks."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:   "Now use command-line editing to wrap your previous expression with the mean() function to compute 
  the mean rank of the name \"Noah\" over decades in which it was ranked."
  CorrectAnswer: mean(baby_clean[baby_clean$boy_name=="Noah","rank"])
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='mean(baby_clean[baby_clean$boy_name=="Noah","rank"])')
  Hint: "Call mean() on your data-frame selection from the previous problem."  

- Class: text
  Output: "Another very common use of the data-frame selection operator [,] is with the order() function to order the rows (or 
  selected columns) of a data-frame by the values in one or more of the columns."

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:   "To demonstrate this, read in the baby_letters data with the expression baby_letters <- read.table(baby_letters_data_path,header=T)"
  CorrectAnswer: baby_letters <- read.table(baby_letters_data_path,header=T)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='baby_letters <- read.table(baby_letters_data_path,header=T)')
  Hint: "Evaluate baby_letters <- read.table(baby_letters_data_path,header=T)"  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:   "Inspect the value of the baby_letters data-frame."
  CorrectAnswer: baby_letters
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='baby_letters')
  Hint: "Evaluate baby_letters"  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:   "Use the order() function to sort the rows of baby_letters by the values of the both.freq_pop column."
  CorrectAnswer: baby_letters[order(baby_letters$both.freq_pop),]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='baby_letters[order(baby_letters$both.freq_pop),]')
  Hint: "Use the order() function inside the data-frame selection operator in the row-slot and put nothing 
  after the comma to select all columns. Select the both.freq_pop from the baby_letters data-frame as the 
  argument to order()"  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output:   "Use command-line editing to wrap the order() expression with the rev() function, so that the rows are sorted 
  descendingly from largest to smallest values of both.freq_pop"
  CorrectAnswer: baby_letters[rev(order(baby_letters$both.freq_pop)),]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='baby_letters[rev(order(baby_letters$both.freq_pop)),]')
  Hint: "Wrap the order() function with the rev() function in your selection."
